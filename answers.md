Ola's Backend Technical Challenge for RaccooPack Media

**Challenge Answers**
Answer #1: Backend Tech Stack


A.) Programming Language Options:
- TypeScript in Node.js environment: TypeScript can add strong typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors during development. Node.js is a popular choice for building scalable and real-time applications.
- C# in Visual Studio Environment: C# is a strongly typed language, which can help catch errors at compile time and improve code maintainability. 



B.) Database Management System Options:
- Relational Database: Given the structured nature of university data (e.g., courses, schedules, student records), a relational database system like Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL or MySQL is a solid choice.

C.) API Framework Options:
 - Express.js is a lightweight and flexible web application framework suitable for building RESTful APIs.
 - ASP.NET Web API is very structured and suitable for building simple and advanced RESTful APIs. This can streamline development and deployment.
 - By using these frameworks, we can provide data access to the frontend to be displayed on a UI by using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.

D.) Cloud Hosting
 - Considering the potential for high traffic, especially during registration periods, using load balancing for the API and cloud-based hosting solutions (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) for scalability.




**API Endpoint Development Considerations**
 - Being created in the .NET ecosystem
 - Making use of Entity Framework to make database objects as entities in .NET environment.
 - This means we are using a Database first approach, and there are already connections to the database in place
 - This also means models and DB context have been scaffolded from the database. The context contains DBSet objects representing database tables
